## Summary
<!-- Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs. -->

The exercise, about replacing the school data with NaN, showed interesting information about how data sets can work. By replacing the data, and not showing the difference, it had large scale affects on the schools placement,  and average scores. Once we went back and cleaned the data to not include those students in the denominator of total students for Thomas high, there were only very slight variations to the values for Average scores in math, and reading. and % scores for math, reading and overall percent. I believe this shows the importance of both, how vital cleaning the data is, and how much NaN fields. can modify integer value reporting.
